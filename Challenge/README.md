### Summary
We noticed that the fare avg is higher in rural than urban and suburban, this could be as the distances are larger. Saying that, our recommendation are considering an increase of drivers in rural areas, with this, we can increase the numbers of rides, we also having more drivers could give more opportunities to have more rides, as probably, we are lossing rides as the lack of drives considering that are longer rides, which means, the customers may are using other services instead ours.
